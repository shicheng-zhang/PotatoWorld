# v10S Release Gates

# Legacy Backlog --> v10S stabilised. v10S game layer added (September 2026).

This document defines the exit criteria for promoting `v10S` to `v10S`.

`v10S` is the stable release form of `v10S`.

v10S is an additive game layer built on top of v10S. It does not modify v10S engine physics code. Its validation is documented in `A3_VALIDATION.md`.

The stable release is not required to be perfect.
It is required to be:

- buildable,
- runnable,
- stable,
- observable,
- documented,
- and repeatable.

## Gate Rules

### P0 Gates

P0 gates are mandatory.

If any P0 gate fails, `v10S` must not be tagged.

### P1 Gates

P1 gates are strongly recommended.

A P1 gate may be deferred only if:

1. it is explicitly documented as a known limitation, and
2. it does not undermine overall stability.

### P2 / P3 Gates

P2 and P3 gates are optional for `v10S`.

They should be recorded as post-stable work items.

- [x] Save/load failure is reported.
- [x] Scene format limitations are documented.

### Performance Sanity

- [x] CPU usage drops when the scene is sleeping.
- [x] Overlay updates do not dominate frame time.
- [x] Redundant sanitization passes are reduced.
- [x] Stress scenes remain usable.

### User Feedback

- [x] Object capacity exhaustion is visible to the user.
- [x] Save/load failure is visible to the user.
- [x] Shader failure is visible to the user.

## Deferred / Post-Stable Work

The following are not required for `v10S`:

- full global-state removal,
- full `PhysicsWorld` encapsulation,
- multithreading,
- continuous collision detection,
- generic constraint framework,
- solver islanding,
- scene format version 2,
- complete UI state-machine rewrite.

These belong after `v10S`.

## v10S Game Layer

v10S adds a Minecraft-style voxel world on top of v10S. The game layer is validated separately:

- [x] V01: ASan+UBSan build passes (0 warnings, 0 errors)
- [x] V02: Clean release build passes (0 warnings, binary produced)
- [x] V03: Headless physics stress test passes (0 NaN, 0 fallen)
- [ ] V04: F10 long-run validation (requires GUI)

The game layer code lives in `src/game/` and does not modify any v10S engine physics files.

---

## Release Decision

`v10S` may be tagged only when:

1. all P0 gates pass,
2. all accepted P1 gates pass or are documented as known limitations,
3. the validation checklist has been run,
4. the repository tree is clean,
5. and the release notes are written.

If any mandatory gate fails, the correct action is:

- fix the gate failure,
- rerun validation,
- and only then re-evaluate `v10S`.
