## 📋 Overview

v10S is a custom-built **3D rigid-body physics engine and real-time rendering pipeline**, written entirely in **C**. It runs on a **zero-dependency core** — the only external requirements are **GTK3** (windowing/UI) and **OpenGL** (render backend).

v10S is built around four priorities:

- **Mathematical transparency** — every integrator, solver, and collision test is hand-written and inspectable.
- **Cache-efficient data layouts** — tightly packed structs and contiguous instance buffers.
- **Deterministic simulation** — fixed-timestep physics decoupled from render framerate.
- **Real-time scaling** — GPU instancing and an O(N) spatial-hash broadphase.

---

## v10S — Game Layer

v10S adds a Minecraft-style voxel world on top of the v10S physics engine. The game layer is additive — no v10S engine physics code is modified.

### Voxel World
- **128 x 64 x 128 block world** (8 x 4 x 8 chunks, 16 blocks per chunk)
- **15 block types:** Air, Grass, Dirt, Stone, Wood, Sand, Water, Plank, Cobble, Brick, Glass, Leaves, Iron, Gold, Diamond
- **Procedural terrain:** hills, flat areas, stone veins, iron, gold, diamond ore
- **Perlin noise** terrain generation with a configurable seed

### Block Interaction
- **Left-click** to destroy a block (via DDA voxel raycast)
- **Right-click** to place the selected block
- **Scroll wheel** to cycle through block types
- HUD shows the current block type

### Rendering
- **GPU-instanced chunk meshing** — only solid, visible faces are meshed
- **Own GLSL Phong shader** for blocks (ambient + diffuse + sun-position lighting)
- Sky-blue background, sun-position lighting (100, 200, 50)
- Bright block colors with 0.5 ambient

### Physics Integration
- **Player-voxel collision:** 3-sphere player model (feet/torso/head) against voxel grid
- **Rigidbody-voxel collision:** dynamic rigidbodies (spheres, cubes) interact with terrain blocks
- Runs per physics substep for stability

## ✨ What's New in v10S

`v10S` completes the release-candidate freeze with a full pass of correctness, stability, validation, documentation, and hygiene fixes. Highlights carried into stable:

- **Domain-driven architecture** — clean `core`, `physics`, `render`, `scene`, `ui_input` modules.
- **Warm-starting contact solver** with multi-point Sutherland–Hodgman manifolds for stable stacking.
- **3D spatial-hash grid broadphase** with adaptive cell sizing.
- **Interactive spring-joint system** with live magenta rendering.
- **POSIX-style debug terminal** — drive the whole simulation from a shell.
- **Built-in validation suite** (F5–F10), including a 60-second long-run stability test.
- **Shader/render failure visibility** — the engine no longer continues silently in a broken render state.

## 🎨 Rendering System

### Hardware-Instanced Rendering
v10S eliminates per-object draw calls using **GPU instancing**:

- The CPU packs model matrices + colors into contiguous buffers.
- The GPU batches all dynamic bodies into **two instanced draws** (spheres, cubes).
- The grid, selection outline, and spring-joint overlay share a utility shader with cached uniform locations.

### Shading
- Custom **GLSL Phong** lighting (ambient + diffuse + specular).
- **Equatorial axis rings** painted on every object (red/green/blue) so rotation is visible at a glance.

## ⚙️ Physics Engine

### Broadphase — Spatial Hash Grid
Objects are mapped into hashed grid buckets; collision checks are limited to local neighborhoods for **average O(N)** scaling. Cell size adapts to object radii. A sleep system removes inactive bodies from the solver.

### Narrowphase
| Pair | Method |
|---|---|
| Sphere–Sphere | Analytical distance test |
| Sphere–OBB | Closest-point projection |
| OBB–OBB | Separating Axis Theorem (15 axes) + Sutherland–Hodgman face clipping |

### Solver
- **Impulse-based sequential solver**, 16 iterations, with **warm starting**.
- Static + kinetic friction, rolling friction, Baumgarte penetration correction.
- Positional depenetration pass for pile stability.

### Integration
- **Semi-implicit (symplectic) Euler** for linear motion.
- **Quaternion-based angular integration** (no gimbal lock).
- **Fixed 60 Hz timestep** with an accumulator and 5-substep cap (spiral-of-death prevention).

## 🐚 Debug Terminal

In Debug Mode, press `T` (or `1`) to open a **POSIX-style shell** over the physics world. The simulation is exposed as a virtual filesystem:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `/obj` | All rigid bodies |
| `/joint` | All spring joints |
| `/world` | World variables (gravity, drag, friction) |
| `/camera` | Camera state |
| `/spawner` | Spawner settings |

A few examples:

```
touch new.sph            # spawn a sphere
ln 1 2                   # spring-join objects 1 and 2
mv 3 /pos/0/10/0         # teleport object 3
chown 5.0 3              # set object 3's mass to 5 kg
chmod static 3           # make it immovable
kill -STOP 3             # put it to sleep
ps aux                   # list every body with state
export GRAVITY=-2.0      # change world gravity
```

Type `help` for the full command list, `man <command>` for usage. `Ctrl+L` clears, `Esc` closes. Mutating commands require Debug Mode; in Game Mode the terminal is read-only.

## 🧪 Validation Tests

v10S ships with built-in stability tests:

| Key | Test |
|---|---|
| `F5` | 10-cube stability stack |
| `F6` | Sleeping cube + moving projectile (sleep/wake) |
| `F7` | Editor torture: select, joint, delete, reset |

| `F9` | Print validation report |
| `F10` | Long-run validation: 3600 ticks (60 s) of idle stability |

`F10` monitors for NaN values, fallen objects, and residual motion, printing `PASS`/`FAIL` at the end.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Wayland:** Mouse locking does not work under native Wayland. Run under X11, or try `GDK_BACKEND=x11 ./engine`.
- **Scene format:** Save/load preserves bodies but **not** spring joints, object IDs, or sleep state. Scene format v2 is planned post-v10S.
- **Object count:** Performance degrades gradually above ~1136 objects; rendering is the primary bottleneck at high counts.
- **Global state:** The engine still uses file-scope globals; full encapsulation is deferred to v15.
- **v10S:** Block placement uses a default block type. Block inventory menu not yet ported from old v10S. Spawn gun mechanics pending.
